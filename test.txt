When an interrupt occurs, the Global Interrupt Enable I-bit is cleared and all interrupts
are disabled. The user software can write logic one to the I-bit to enable nested interrupts. All enabled interrupts can then interrupt the current interrupt routine. The I-bit is
automatically set when a Return from Interrupt instruction  RETI  is executed.s
There are basically two types of interrupts. The first type is triggered by an event that
sets the interrupt flag. For these interrupts, the Program Counter is vectored to the
actual Interrupt Vector in order to execute the interrupt handling routine, and hardware
clears the corresponding interrupt flag. Interrupt flags can also be cleared by writing a
logic one to the flag bit position(s) to be cleared. If an interrupt condition occurs while the
corresponding interrupt enable bit is cleared, the interrupt flag will be set and remembered until the interrupt is enabled, or the flag is cleared by software. Similarly, if one or
more interrupt conditions occur while the Global Interrupt Enable bit is cleared, the corresponding interrupt flag(s) will be set and remembered until the global interrupt enable
bit is set, and will then be executed by order of priority.
